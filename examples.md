## Basic Usage in Nix Expressions:
### mkPython / mkPythonShell
build a python environment from a list of requirements
```nix
let
  mach-nix = import (builtins.fetchGit {
    url = "https://github.com/DavHau/mach-nix/";
    ref = "2.2.2";
  });
in mach-nix.mkPython {
  requirements = builtins.readFile ./requirements.txt;
}
```

### buildPythonPackage / buildPythonApplication
Build a python package from its source code and a list of requirements
```nix
let
  mach-nix = import (builtins.fetchGit {
    url = "https://github.com/DavHau/mach-nix/";
    ref = "2.2.2";
  });
in mach-nix.buildPythonPackage {
  pname = "my-package";
  version = "1.0.0";
  src = /project-path;
  requirements = builtins.readFile /project-path/requirements.txt;
}
```

### buildPythonPackage from GitHub
Build a python package from its source code and a list of requirements
```nix
let
  mach-nix = import (builtins.fetchGit {
    url = "https://github.com/DavHau/mach-nix/";
    ref = "2.2.2";
  });
in mach-nix.buildPythonPackage rec {
  pname = "projectname";
  version = "1.0.0";
  src = builtins.fetchGit{
    url = "https://github.com/user/projectname";
    ref = "master";
    # rev = "put_commit_hash_here";
  };
  doCheck = false;
  doInstallCheck = false;
  requirements = builtins.readFile "${src}/requirements.txt";
}
```

## Examples for Tensorflow / PyTorch

### Tensorflow with SSE/AVX/FMA support
I have a complex set of requirements including tensorflow. I'd like to have tensorflow with the usual nix features enabled like SSE/AVX/FMA which I cannot get from pypi. Therefore I must take tensorflow from nixpkgs. For everything else I keep the default, which means wheels are preferred. This allows for quicker installation of dependencies.
```nix
let
  mach-nix = import (builtins.fetchGit {
    url = "https://github.com/DavHau/mach-nix/";
    ref = "2.2.2";
  });
in mach-nix.mkPython {

  requirements = ''
    # bunch of other requirements
    tensorflow
  '';

  providers = {
    # force tensorflow to be taken from nixpkgs
    tensorflow = "nixpkgs"; 
  };
}
```
This only works if the restrictions in `requirements.txt` allow for the tensorflow version from nixpkgs.

### Tensorflow via wheel (newer versions, quicker builds)
I'd like to install a more recent version of tensorflow which is not available from nixpkgs. Also I don't like long build times and therefore I want to install tensorflow via wheel. Usually most wheels work pretty well out of the box, but the tensorflow wheel has an issue which I need to fix with an override.
```nix
let
  mach-nix = import (builtins.fetchGit {
    url = "https://github.com/DavHau/mach-nix/";
    ref = "2.2.2";
  });
in mach-nix.mkPython {

  requirements = ''
    # bunch of other requirements
    tensorflow == 2.2.0rc4
  '';

  # no need to specify provider settings since wheel is the default anyways

  # Fix the tensorflow wheel
  overrides_post = [( pythonSelf: pythonSuper: {
    tensorflow = pythonSuper.tensorflow.overridePythonAttrs ( oldAttrs: {
      postInstall = ''
        rm $out/bin/tensorboard
      '';
    });
  })];
}

```

### Recent PyTorch with nixpkgs dependencies, overlays, and custom python
I'd like to use a recent version of Pytorch from wheel, but I'd like to build the rest of the requirements from sdist or nixpkgs, since I've already written overlays for those packages which I'd like to continue using. Also I require python 3.6
```nix
let
  mach-nix = import (builtins.fetchGit {
    url = "https://github.com/DavHau/mach-nix/";
    ref = "2.2.2";
  });
overlays = []; # some very useful overlays
in mach-nix.mkPython rec {

  requirements = ''
    # bunch of other requirements
    torch == 1.5.0
  '';

  providers = {
    # disallow wheels by default
    _default = "nixpkgs,sdist";
    # allow wheels only for torch
    torch = "wheel";
  };

  # Include my own overlay.
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> { config = { allowUnfree = true; }; inherit overlays; };

  # Select custom python version (Must be taken from pkgs with the overlay applied)
  python = pkgs.python36;
}
```

## Using overrides
### Fixing packages via overrides
See previous example for tensorflow wheel

### Include poetry2nix overrides
I have a complex requirements.txt which includes `imagecodecs`. It is available via wheel, but I prefer to build everything from source. This package has complex build dependencies and is not available from nixpkgs. Luckily poetry2nix` overrides make it work. The peotry2nix overrides depend on nixpkgs-unstable.
```nix
let
  mach-nix = import (builtins.fetchGit {
    url = "https://github.com/DavHau/mach-nix/";
    ref = "2.2.2";
  });
in mach-nix.mkPython rec {

  requirements = ''
    # bunch of other requirements
    imagecodecs
  '';

  providers = {
    _default = "sdist";
  };

  # Use unstable channel
  pkgs = import <unstable> {};

  # Import overrides from poetry2nix
  # Caution! Use poetry2nix overrides only in `overrides_post`, not `overrides_pre`.
  overrides_post = [
    (
      import (builtins.fetchurl {
        url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nix-community/poetry2nix/1cfaa4084d651d73af137866622e3d0699851008/overrides.nix";
      }) { inherit pkgs; }
    )
  ];
}
```
